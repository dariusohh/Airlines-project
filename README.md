# Airlines-project

Data Visualisation Project

Through manipulation of the data using Pandas and data visualisation tools such as Excel and Tableau, we came up with a presentation to show how we dived deep into the data for two Airlines and compare both of them in terms of efficiency.

Beta Airlines is known to be a top-performing Airlines with much better efficiency and lower flight delays as compared to Alpha Airlines. Through the manipulation of data, we managed to gather meaningful insights on why this is the case and the areas of improvement for Alpha Airlines.
